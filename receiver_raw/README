receiver_raw, bgworker receiver working with decoder_raw
================================================================================
This module is a background worker able to receive changes generated by
the logical replication output plugin called decoder_raw that generates raw
SQL queries that can be applied to remote sources.

This module has still very basic features, but is is able to receive changes
and start logical replication with a remote server.

TODO
====
- Define a set of options for receiver
- Send feedback to source about written and flushed LSN
- Change main loop such as all changes are consumed until there is no
more data in the COPY fetch. Now one tuple is fetched per loop cycle...
