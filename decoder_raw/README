decoder_raw, Output plugin for logical replication
================================================================================

This output plugin for logical replication generates raw queries based
on the logical changes it finds. Those queries can be consumed as they
are by any remote source.

The following options can be used:
- include-transaction, 'on' will print BEGIN and COMMIT messages, while
'off' prints empty strings
